# Subject-Conditioned Resting-State EEG

Scenario 2 studies subject- and eye-state-conditioned generation with MPI-LEMON resting EEG. Scenario 1 remains frozen separately.

## Current status

**Batch 005 final remainder is authorized for planning and execution.** It includes all 65 remaining structural candidates in authoritative order, beginning with sub-010242; its exact computed network cap is 42,976,220,335 bytes, with zero unused capacity and no unassigned candidate after freeze. Batch 006 is prohibited. Engineering completion still requires 211 verified outputs and final acceptance. See [final remainder operating guide](docs/BATCH_005_FINAL_REMAINDER_RUNNER.md). The prior completed state below is preserved as the starting context.

**BATCH_004_AUTONOMOUS_RESUME_COMPLETE.** The existing 45-GiB Batch 004 is **74/74 technically complete with 1,184 verified blocks**, zero unresolved subjects, and no remaining partials. All 62 previously unresolved members completed in frozen order; the 12 existing Batch 004 outputs and 72 earlier completions are unchanged. The ledger is `complete`.

The preserved **504-MiB sub-010232 prefix** resumed with exact HTTP 206/Content-Range and passed full size/SHA256 verification. New response-body traffic was **39,959,722,354 bytes**, with **zero new outage episodes, reconnections, or extra retry bodies**. Unlimited network waiting, strict Range recovery, a persistent supervisor, watchdog, and safe stop remain implemented and tested.

Batch 004 has **71 Train-QC passes and 68 provisional-feasibility passes**. Raw was deleted for 71 passing subjects and retained for sub-010146, sub-010163, and sub-010234 under frozen QC rules. Cumulative progress is **146/211 complete subjects / 2,336 blocks**, **140 Train-QC passes**, **136 provisional-feasibility passes**, and **65 unassigned candidates**. Total processed storage is **1,736,840,551 bytes**; retained raw is **3,902,615,061 bytes**.

**355 offline tests, compileall, the read-only verifier, and preservation/accounting checks passed.** Scientific rules and Train-only fitting remain frozen. No scientific held-out analysis, normalization fit, final cohort/split lock, Batch 005, or push occurred. See the [final autonomous resume handoff](docs/BATCH_004_AUTONOMOUS_RESUME_HANDOFF.md) and [runner/safe-stop guide](docs/BATCH_004_AUTONOMOUS_RUNNER.md). Earlier handoffs remain historical evidence.

## Verified dataset facts

- 215 subject directories and 215 participant rows.
- Every subject has 62 channel rows: 61 EEG and 1 EOG (`VEOG`), not 62 EEG.
- All 19 target scalp channels are present and marked good for all subjects.
- Native sampling rates are 2500 Hz for 208 subjects, 1000 Hz for 6, and 500 Hz for 1.
- `Stimulus/S200` means EO and `Stimulus/S210` means EC.
- `Stimulus/S208` is mapped to EC only for `sub-010078` and `sub-010126`, using documented subject-level evidence.
- Distributed participant-level age, sex, handedness, weight, and height values are all `n/a`; demographic distortion cannot be tested from the local table.

## Structural cohort and split status

The four structural exclusions are:

- `sub-010015`: only 3 EO/3 EC runs; final EO is truncated.
- `sub-010100`: only 5 EO/6 EC runs; final EC is truncated and the sixth EO is absent.
- `sub-010203`: no events table and zero marker entries in its header-only `.vmrk`.
- `sub-010285`: no EO/EC state markers.

The remaining 211 subjects each have eight complete EO and eight complete EC blocks after explicit acquisition-interruption fragments are separated for `sub-010059` and `sub-010081`. Therefore 5 Train / 1 Validation / 2 Test blocks per subject and state is structurally feasible.

[`outputs/metrics/scenario2/provisional_block_split_manifest.csv`](outputs/metrics/scenario2/provisional_block_split_manifest.csv) is explicitly `PROVISIONAL_METADATA_ONLY`; it is not final or locked. Final membership requires waveform QC, a checksum, and a new commit.

## Reproduce the pre-download package

From the repository root:

```powershell
. .\scripts\setup_scenario2_environment.ps1 -ForTests
python scripts/audit/s2_01_audit_metadata.py
python scripts/audit/s2_02_audit_blocks.py
python scripts/audit/s2_03_build_structural_cohort.py
python scripts/audit/s2_04_audit_demographics.py
python scripts/audit/s2_05_plan_splits_and_downloads.py
python -m pytest -q --basetemp "D:/SHARIF/PROJECT/Datasets/MPI-LEMON-Scenario2/temp/pytest"
```

These commands read only local metadata. The prepared downloader is validation-only unless its explicit `--execute` flag is supplied.

## Planned study

The study asks whether subject-conditioned synthetic EEG preserves individual EO-to-EC alpha physiology, spatial alpha structure, and functional connectivity on held-out recording blocks, and whether synthetic augmentation improves held-out real classification across at least three classifiers. Validation and Test remain real-only; complete recording blocks are the atomic split unit.


## 2026-09-05: frozen mechanical held-out authorization

This amendment is written and committed before the first held-out value read.
The user separately authorizes mechanical access to the 90 provisional Validation/Test
blocks of the existing 15 pilot subjects through `MechanicalHeldoutAccessGate`.
The frozen preprocessing YAML and SHA256 remain unchanged:
`5ed46e77f318e2f6162cbd34f600951980117cef979bbdf12640094721d7947b`.
The separate `configs/access/mechanical_heldout_v1.yaml` defines access purposes,
manifest hashes and apply-only restrictions; it contains no preprocessing parameters.

Validation/Test may apply verified Train-derived thresholds and bad-channel decisions
but cannot fit any parameter, including normalization. Allowed operations are frozen
preprocessing, fixed waveform QC, compact storage and output verification. Scientific
outcomes remain sealed: no PSD, Alpha, IAF, topology, Connectivity, wPLI, classifier,
generator, TSTR, augmentation, plots, tuning or scientific evaluation is authorized.
All 150 previously exposed pilot blocks must remain Train or their subject must be
excluded. Reuse their existing verified compact datasets without native Train rereads.
Process sub-010250 identically and preserve its frozen Train-QC failure.

Store all 16 complete blocks, including ineligible blocks with masks and reasons, in
separate all-block HDF5 files. Keep the old Train files and original access registry.
Provisional feasibility requires frozen Train QC (at least three eligible blocks per
state), both assigned Validation blocks and all four assigned Test blocks eligible,
plus source/header/output verification. No spare held-out blocks, reassignment,
threshold changes, or subject rescue is permitted. This does not lock a final cohort,
final split or final Test, and normalization remains unfitted.

All-block storage and complete provenance/journal verification are now mandatory
before any future explicitly requested raw deletion, superseding earlier Train-only
cleanup eligibility. No pilot raw deletion, non-pilot download, metadata clone change,
or Git push is authorized in this phase. Future streaming supports `--processing-scope
all-blocks-mechanical`: fit on Train first, then mechanically apply to held-out, verify
all 16 blocks, durably journal, and delete only with the explicit guarded flag.


## Variable streaming batches and external storage (Batch 001 authorization)

Batch 001 has a maximum **5 GiB = 5,368,709,120 bytes** of declared `.eeg` plus `.vhdr` payload. Future batch caps are chosen separately by the user; no future membership is generated now. Frozen caps, membership, manifest hashes, and subject order are immutable. The planner excludes verified completed outputs and previously assigned subjects, follows the authoritative candidate order, and stops at the first subject that does not fit. It does not pack smaller later subjects into a gap or pull replacements after failure.

Execution uses only the frozen manifest and a durable authorization referencing committed code. It processes one new raw subject at a time: verified download/resume, Train-only parameter fitting, mechanical apply-only held-out processing, verified 16-block HDF5 and receipt, durable completion journal, then guarded raw cleanup before the next subject. Passing Train QC is required for deletion; legitimate held-out 5/1/2 infeasibility alone does not block technical cleanup. Download/preprocessing failures, partial files, and Train-QC failures retain raw. The first subject is checked as a canary. Infrastructure/software failure stops for investigation and a committed correction under the same membership and cap.

Expected network payload is reported separately from measured response-body bytes. Measurement includes received retry bodies; HTTP/TLS/ISP overhead is not measured. Existing verified files reduce expected transfer. Partial lengths are resumable prefixes, not cryptographically verified incomplete data; final whole-file SHA256 remains mandatory and ignored HTTP Range can increase transfer.

Large Scenario 2 data is deliberately external to Git, under `D:/SHARIF/PROJECT/Datasets/MPI-LEMON-Scenario2/`: `raw/`, `processed/all-blocks-v1/`, preserved `processed/train-only-v1/`, `temp/`, and `runtime/`. The original `D:/SHARIF/PROJECT/Datasets/MPI-LEMON` metadata clone remains read-only. `configs/paths/data_paths.yaml` commits relative defaults; an ignored `configs/paths/local_data_paths.yaml` or `SCENARIO2_PATH_CONFIG` may override local paths. Authorizations record resolved absolute paths. Batch commands refuse path substitutions that differ from this centralized policy.

Pilot migration inventories and verifies destination bytes and both sets of compact outputs before removing old copies. Original HDF5 files and receipts remain byte-identical; the relocation resolver translates their historical output paths. Small manifests, ledger, authorization, metrics and summaries remain in the repository; detailed batch runtime journals and processing caches are external. The migration summary records counts, hashes, roots and verification.

This is a storage and engineering change only. Frozen preprocessing/QC and provisional split rules are unchanged. Scientific held-out outcomes remain sealed, no waveform plots are produced, normalization remains unfitted, and no final cohort is locked. All commits are local; no push is authorized. **Batch 002 is neither planned nor executed, and its cap remains undecided.**

## Batch 001 interruption and durable D: temp/cache policy

The user manually stopped Batch 001 after C: fell to approximately 600 MB free, then manually cleared about 7.7 GB of pip cache; C: recovered to approximately 8.8 GiB. The agent did not change Windows pagefile configuration. `sub-010002` had already passed source/output/provenance verification and Train QC, and its raw directory was safely deleted. `sub-010003` retained a 419,430,400-byte waveform partial for strict HTTP Range resume.

Dot-source `scripts/setup_scenario2_environment.ps1` in every new shell before running Python, streaming, verification, compileall, or pip. It resolves the central path policy and sets TEMP/TMP/TMPDIR, pip, matplotlib, joblib, Python bytecode, MNE and XDG cache/config paths under the external D: Scenario 2 root. It verifies Python `tempfile.gettempdir()` in the execution environment. `-ForTests` also checks the system-drive guard. All remaining pytest runs explicitly use `--basetemp D:/SHARIF/PROJECT/Datasets/MPI-LEMON-Scenario2/temp/pytest`; pytest refuses another base and keeps its own cache external. Check for another running pytest process before reusing that base.

The Windows stability guard stops before subject download/resume, asset requests, preprocessing, and full tests if C: free space is below 3 GiB (3,221,225,472 bytes), recording `c_drive_low_space_guard` while preserving files and journals. Project-controlled data/temp/cache writes remain on D:. Reading Python installed on C: is permitted. This policy covers project-controlled writes, not unrelated applications or OS-managed storage.

The original Batch 001 authorization, plan, manifest hash, cap and membership are preserved. A separate numbered resume authorization references the original authorization hash, the committed hardening code, reverified completed subjects, remaining-transfer preflight, and exact environment. `sub-010002` is reused without raw recreation or processing. `sub-010003` resumes from its preserved prefix; validated HTTP Content-Range and actual new response-body bytes are recorded. Batch 002 remains unplanned, and all scientific/QC rules remain unchanged.
